# Biological Rhythms Conference: Analyzing cycling gene expression data 
## It was really called: Statistics and Modelling: Analysis of Genome Scale Circadian Data (A) 


* John Hogenesch, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center .  
* Tanya Leise, Amherst College .  

## Date 2018-05-12; Saturday 



## Description: 

*In this workshop, you’ll learn about installing software to analyze genome

Along the way, you’ll learn some key principles to design and analysis of
these studies -- ‘golden rules’.*
